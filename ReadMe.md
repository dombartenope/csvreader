# To use this code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure that the input file, input.csv, is in the same directory as main.cpp
- This should contain the data you want to search
- The column names will automatically be moved to the output
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++: 
`g++ main.cpp -o main`
4. Run `./main` from the terminal after building
5. Add your query, or multiple queries,when prompted in the terminal to search
6. Type "!done" when you are done adding searches

## The program will read the input file, input.csv, and create a new output file, output.csv, in the same directory. The output file will contain the same data as the input file, but only the lines that contain the string will be written to the output file.

### Change the color of your terminal output by setting colorMode to true. (This only applies if your terminal allows ANSI Color Codes)
