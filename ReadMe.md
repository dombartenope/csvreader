# To use this code, follow these instructions:

1. Save this code in a file named file.cpp
2. Make sure that the input file, file.csv, is in the same directory as file.cpp
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++: 
`g++ file.cpp -o file`
4. Add your query when prompted in the terminal to search
5. Run the compiled program: ./file

## The program will read the input file, file.csv, and create a new output file, output.csv, in the same directory. The output file will contain the same data as the input file, but only the lines that contain the string will be written to the output file.

### Change the color of your terminal output by setting colorMode to true. (This only applies if your terminal accepts ANSI Color Codes)
